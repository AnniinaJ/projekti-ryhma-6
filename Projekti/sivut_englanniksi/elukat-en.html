        <p>We specialize in the sale of food and care supplies for the animals featured on the site.
            Below you can read more about these animals and their care needs. You can also contact our vet,

        <h3>Lithuanian unicorn</h3>
        <p>The Lithuanian unicorn is a rare horse-like animal that can be found in the wild in a Lithuanian nature reserve.
            The unicorn chooses its owner, so it cannot be bought or caught in the wild.
            It usually doesn't let its owner ride it. However, it is suitable as a pet,
            as long as it is taken good enough care.
        </p><br>
        <p>Unicorns need golden apples in addition to ordinary hay, which only grow there,
            where unicorns have lived. <a href="myymälä-en.html">In our store</a> you can buy food for unicorns.
        </p><br>
        <p>The Lithuanian unicorn needs to be brushed daily. It is also good to treat the horn with its conditioners.
            You can buy coat, horn and hoof care products from our store.
        </p><br>

        <h3>North-Savonian Greyfluffer</h3>
        <p>Greyfluffer's appearance can seem clumsy and lazy, but do not get fooled since it can suprise you with it's agility and strong predator instincts.
            With good luck, you may run into these creatures in wilderness in the forests of North-Savo. They are very rare though and wont often show themselves to people.</p><br>
        <p>When tamed Greyfluffers are usually very cuddly and playful. Ofter in the beginning very shy, but bonds strongly. Bottomless appetite. </p><br>
            <p>Greyfluffer has a carnivore diet and it must be fed at least two times a day. Especially suitable food is fish and poultry. As a treat, for example dried chicken feet or dried Spotty Swampcrawler. </p><br>

        <h3>Lentolisko</h3>
        <p>This lentolisko is from New Zealand. Lentolisko especially like climbing
            and from high places. In appearance lentolisko may resemble a dragon, 
            but the narrow essence brings out the much-talked-about lizard-like.
        </p><br>
        <p>Lentolisko eat a variety of insects and larvae. However, this individual’s favorite food is ice cream.</p><br>
